const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const serviceAccount = require('./service-account.json'); // User will need to provide this, or I rely on default creds if environment is set up.
// Actually, I can use the existing 'functions/index.js' setup context if I run it via firebase-functions shell locally, 
// OR I can just use a simple script if I have credentials.
// Since I don't have service-account.json key file, I'll try to use the 'functions' environment if possible, 
// OR simpler: I will create a CLIENT SIDE diagnostic component that the user can run.
// A node script won't work easily without a key file.

// BETTER APPROACH: creating a 'DebugPage' component that lists raw data from 'api.ts' and adding it to routes.
// This uses the authenticated user's credentials (which are valid).
